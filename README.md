# My Awesome Project
This was my first project. A website for a spa that included multiple pages to describe services. 

**Link to project:** https://driftspa.netlify.app/

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS

I used a HTML5 template to as a starting point for this website. I then adjusted all HTML and CSS to match branding for spa. 

## Lessons Learned:

As my first project, this was a greating starting point. It allowed me to play with and gain a deeper undertanding of CSS and JS. I used this template to learn more about file structure for projects and also about root variables.  

## Examples:
Take a look at these examples that I have in my portfolio:
